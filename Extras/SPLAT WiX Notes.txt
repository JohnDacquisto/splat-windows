Notes for building SPLAT MSI using WiX.

(1) Build all SPLAT projects in Release mode, after updating version numbers and other settings & files appropriately (version.h).
- Keep a copy of the SPLAT Release build .pdb files, for debugging minidump files.

(2) Open the SplatInstaller.wxs file, update the Product Version number to match the settings in step 1. Make other edits as needed (adding/removing files, shortcuts, environment variables, registry settings, etc.). Once finished, save and close the .wxs file.
- Make sure to NOT touch the "Upgrade Code", as it must remain the same across all MSIs for a specific application.
- If adding a new COM DLL/OCX file, need to extract the COM information. WiX has tools to facilitate the extraction.

(3) Build the SplatInstaller project in Release mode to generate the MSI.

(4) Some notes on MSI validation:
- To install the MSI, start the Command Prompt as Administrator, navigate to the directory with the MSI, and run: "msiexec /i splat.msi addlocal=all allusers=2 /qb"
"addlocal=all" installs all features in the MSI locally.
"allusers=2" performs a per-machine installation (rather than per-user).
"/qb" runs the installer in basic UI mode (only progress bar and Cancel button).
- If there are any issues with the install, include "/l*v log.txt" as well, to generate a verbose log file.
- After installing the MSI, ensure the expected files are present in Program Files, and the PATH variable was updated.
- To uninstall the MSI, start the command prompt as Administrator, navigate to the directory with the MSI, and run: "msiexec /x splat.msi"
The uninstall removes files from Program Files, and reverts the PATH variable change.
